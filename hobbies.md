When I'm not debugging N-body codes or analyzing star particles, you can find me:

* **[Hobby 1]:** A brief sentence about what you do.
* **[Hobby 2]:** Maybe something active or creative.
* **Astrophotography:** (Optional) Since you study the stars, showing you also look at them through a lens is always a hit.
