**PhD Student in Astrophysics** *Department of Physics & Astronomy | [University Name]*

I study the formation and evolution of the Milky Way Galaxy using high-resolution cosmological simulations. My research focuses on the **stellar structure** of the Galactic disc and halo, utilizing the **FIRE-2** and **GASOLINE** codebases to bridge the gap between theoretical models and observational data.

### Research Interests
* Galactic Archaeology
* Stellar Kinematics in the MW
* Feedback-driven Galaxy Formation
* Numerical Simulations (FIRE-2, GASOLINE)
